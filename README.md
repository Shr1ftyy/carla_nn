# Level 2 Autonomous Driving System - Using Carla #

## TODO: ##
- Research on different ANN Architectures to use - currently thinking of using a VAE and Inception CNN with 
residual connections.
- Implement LSTM after flattening (cnnLSTM)
- Set up data trigger infrastructure - data collection for edge cases
- Get at least a toy implementation of ORBSlam up and running

# Goal:
My final goal is to get a Level 2 Self-Driving System up and running as soon as possible (will take some time)
