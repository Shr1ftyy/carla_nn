# Level 3 Autonomous Driving System - Using Carla

# Next Update:
- Multi-camera input and data collation

# TODO:
- Get sensor suite up and working
- Research on different ANN Architecture to use - currently thinking of using a VAE and Inception CNN with 
residual connections
- Get neural network up and running
- Clean up codebase, etc. 

# Goal:
My final goal is to get a Level 2 Self-Driving System up and running as soon as possible (will take some time)
