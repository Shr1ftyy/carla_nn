# Level 2-3 Autonomous Driving System - Using Carla #

- orbslam.py - toy implementation of monocular SLAM (ORBSlam) - INCOMPLETE
- model.py - Neural Network Model - architecture needs improvement
- renderer.py - Radar point cloud visualization

## TODO: ##
- Research on different ANN Architectures to use - currently thinking of using a VAE and Inception CNN with 
residual connections.
- Implement LSTM after flattening (cnnLSTM)
- Set up data trigger infrastructure - data collection for edge cases
- Get at least a toy implementation of ORBSlam up and running

# Goal:
My final goal is to get a Level 2-3 Self-Driving System up and running as soon as possible (will take some time)
