# Level 3 Autonomous Driving System - Using Carla #

## TODO: ##
- Research on different ANN Architecture to use - currently thinking of using a VAE and Inception CNN with 
residual connections
- Get neural network up and running
- Clean up codebase, etc. 
- Figure out how to make custom layers, take full advantage of tensorflow's
or pytorch's API
- Figure out how to make CNN accept multi-image input
- Implement LSTM after flattening (cnnLSTM)
- Deploy the model, train in realtime
- Set up data trigger infrastructure

# Goal:
My final goal is to get a Level 2 Self-Driving System up and running as soon as possible (will take some time)
